# auto-sort

This program (auto_sort.py) will automatically sort your files in the given folder in settings.json.

Settings.json is where you specify:
The extensions you want to track.
The folder you want to track.
The destination for the certain file extension in the given folder.
Takes env variables like so: " $ENV_NAME$ "

When you've customized settings.json, I will recommend binding auto_sort.py to startup.
